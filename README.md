Install Android Studio, as well as `react-native-debugger`. 

Initial setup for Android Studio:

* Don't import settings
* Do custom install & add latest SDK
* From the Welcome Screen, go to Configure -> SDK Manager
    * Install other SDKs (Android 7.0+)
* From Welcome Screen, choose "Open an existing Android Studio project"
    * Import an existing project: open the `android/` directory.
* Let Gradle automatically sync
  * it will probably fail several times, just keep clicking the blue links to install any missing dependencies

To start developing:
* CD into the project's root and run `yarn` to install node dependencies
* Open AVD Manager and run a device emulator
* After a "cold boot", use `yarn android:run` to get the app loaded onto the phone
* run `yarn start` to start the dev server
* hit "R+R" to reload any changes
* run `yarn android:shake` to connect to the `react-native-debugger`

## XCode ##

* Download and install Xcode from App Store
* From Welcome Screen, choose "Open another project"
    * Import an existing project: open the `ios/` directory and open the .xcworkspace file.

To start developing:
* CD into the project's root and run `yarn` to install node dependencies
* Cd into `ios/` and run `pod install` (You need to have Cocoapods installed)
* From Xcode select a simulator and press `build` button
